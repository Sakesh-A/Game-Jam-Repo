A Climate Change Strategy Game by The Cat Coders

Created for the 2025 C3 Game Jam

A community-focused resource management game exploring the cascading effects of climate change in Sierra Nevada, Spain. Players must navigate real-world trade-offs in sustaining biodiversity and community well-being by managing water supply and maintaining traditional irrigation systems in response to climate-driven challenges. Through strategic decision-making, the game fosters an understanding of climate adaptation, resource scarcity, and the long-term impacts of environmental change on ecosystems and livelihoods, particularly in areas like Sierra Nevada.
